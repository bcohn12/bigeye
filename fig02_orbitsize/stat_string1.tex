The ratio was $0.131 \pm 0.04$  ($N=19$) (all numbers $\pm$ standard deviation) for the Tetrapodomorph Fish, and $0.240 \pm  0.06$ ($N=18$) for the Stem Tetrapods. A two-tailed  T-test (assuming unequal variance) rejected the null hypothesis that the means come from the same distribution ($p = 0.00000011$). A Wilcoxon rank sum test also rejects the null hypothesis ($p = 0.0000015$), as did a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ($p = 0.000006$).
