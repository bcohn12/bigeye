 The finned tetrapods had eye sockets that were $15 \pm 9.3$~mm long (all numbers mean $\pm$ standard deviation), while the digited tetrapods had eye sockets that were 33 $\pm$ 20~mm long. Relative eye socket length, expressed as a percentage of skull length, was 13 $\pm$ 4.1\% ($N=21$) for the finned tetrapods, and 20 $\pm$  6.6\% ($N=38$) for the digited tetrapods.

The finned tetrapods exclusive of the transitional elpistostegalians had eye sockets that were $13 \pm 8.7$~mm, and  $13 \pm 4.3$~\%. Elpistostegalians ($N=3$) alone were $24 \pm 8$~mm, and $12 \pm 2.8$~\%. The digited tetrapods without the secondarily aquatic colosteid-adelospondyls had socket lengths of $36 \pm 20$~mm, while the colosteid-adelospondyls ($N=6$) alone had sockets that were $14 \pm 8.7$~mm. The corresponding relative socket lengths were $21 \pm 6.9$~\% and $17 \pm 3.3$~\%, respectively.
