The ratio was $0.14 \pm 0.05$  ($N=21$) (all numbers $\pm$ standard deviation) for the Tetrapodomorph Fish, and 0.24 \pm  0.05$ ($N=18$) for the Stem Tetrapods. A two-tailed  T-test (assuming unequal variance) rejected the null hypothesis that the means come from the same distribution ($p = 0.00000077$). A Wilcoxon rank sum test also rejects the null hypothesis ($p = 0.0000080$), as did a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ($p = 0.000037$).
