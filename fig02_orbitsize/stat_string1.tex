 The tetrapodomorph fish had orbits that were $15 \pm 9.3$~mm long (all numbers mean $\pm$ standard deviation), while the stem tetrapods had orbits that were $33 \pm 22$~mm long. The ratio of orbit length to skull length was $0.13 \pm 0.04$  ($N=21$) for the tetrapodomorph fish, and $0.21 \pm  0.06$ ($N=31$) for the stem tetrapods.
